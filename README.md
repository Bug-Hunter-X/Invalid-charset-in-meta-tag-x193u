# Invalid Character Set in Meta Tag

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML error related to using an invalid `charset` value within the `&lt;meta&gt;` tag.  Improper character set declarations can result in incorrect display of characters, particularly those outside the standard ASCII range.

The `bug.html` file showcases the error. The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the correct implementation.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the potential display issues due to the incorrect `charset` specification.
3. Compare this to the correct implementation in `bugSolution.html`.
